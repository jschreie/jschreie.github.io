# About

I am a marine microbial ecologist who is passionate about understanding microbial community interactions within the context of carbon cycling in the ocean. Using model systems, my research has centered around heterotrophic bacteria interacting over a shared pool of resources produced by phytoplankton, spanning from planktonic communities in the surface ocean to particle associated communities below the photic zone. I utilize molecular techniques combined with growth assays and microscopy to characterize the metabolites underpinning interactions between bacterial populations to better understand and quantify the flow of carbon in these systems. Currently, I am focused on the potential role bacteriophage play in controlling the remineralization of organic aggregates generated by phytoplankton.
