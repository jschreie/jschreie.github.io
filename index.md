# About

I am a marine microbial ecologist who is passionate about understanding interactions between individuals and populations that occur in communities. I recieved my Bachelors of Marine Science from Rutgers in 2014, and my PhD in Marine Sciences from UGA in 2023 under the supervision of Dr. Mary Ann Moran. The science I have engaged in has heavily focused on the molecular and chemical mechanisms involved in interactions that occur in microbial communitites.
